**Travis CI** - add badges for a node.js github project/library.

- build-pass details
- code-coverage
- npm version 



### Set up Travis CI ( + build-pass details )

- **Create a `.travis.yml` file in your project root folder. A simple `.travis.yml` can contain only the following attributes** 

  ```yaml
    language: node_js
    node_js:
      - 11.5.0
  ```
  *In the above example, I am using node.js and my node version is 11.5.0. Example : [ Sized-Balanced-Tree / .travis.yml](https://github.com/pallab-gain/Sized-Balanced-Tree/blob/master/.travis.yml)*




- We also need to register our github project in travis-ci. To do that,** 
  
  - goto https://travis-ci.org/account/repositories
  
  - Search for your repositories
  
  - Enable if they are not already enabled.
  
    
  
- **Add some test code in your library, and add it in your `package.json`.**

  ```json
  "scripts": {
      "test": "mocha ./__test__/src/sbt/tree.test.js"
  }
  ```

  *In the above example, I used `mocha`, and `chai`, and my test are are located int he following directory. Example : [Sized-Balanced-Tree / package.json](https://github.com/pallab-gain/Sized-Balanced-Tree/blob/master/package.json)*

  

- **Now everytime you publish in master branch, you should see travis CI is building, and testing**


  - https://travis-ci.org/pallab-gain/Sized-Balanced-Tree

  - Click on the [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pallab-gain/Sized-Balanced-Tree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pallab-gain/Sized-Balanced-Tree) image of your integration, and copy the Markdown snippet. Now, paste the snippet to your github readme. 

    

- **At this point your should be able to see your Travis CI implementation.**
